    <string name="paragraph2">It is situated on a mountain ridge above the Sacred Valley which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco and through which the Urubamba River flows. Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was built as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often mistakenly referred to as the Lost City of the Incas, it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. \n\nThe Incas built the estate around 1450, but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world before being brought to international attention in 1911 by the American historian Hiram Bingham. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of what the structures originally looked like. By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored; restoration continues today. \n\nMachu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historical Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide Internet poll. </string>

    <string name="videoParagraph1">Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly
    herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of central Africa.

\n\nThe 360 video below shows gorillas in the Congo rainforest.

  <string name="videoParagraph2">The eponymous genus Gorilla is divided into two
    species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four or
    five subspecies. They are the largest living primates by physical size.

\n\nThe DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95–99%
    depending on what is counted, and they are the next closest living relatives
    to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos.

\n\nGorillas\' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Africa.
    Although their range covers a small percentage of Africa, gorillas cover a
    wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift
    montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude
    from 2,200–4,300 metres (7,200–14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense
    forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western
    lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland
    gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda
